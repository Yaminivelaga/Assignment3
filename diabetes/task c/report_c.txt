Using 500 bootstrap samples of size 150, we estimated the mean, standard deviation, and 98th percentile for BloodPressure. The results showed that the bootstrap averages were closely aligned with the actual population values, indicating that the method effectively captures key statistical patterns. The histograms of the bootstrap distributions further confirmed this by showing a tight clustering around the population metrics. This highlights the strength of bootstrap as a reliable resampling technique, especially when dealing with complex statistics or when traditional assumptions about the data, like normality, may not hold.
