The 98th percentile tells us the BMI value that 98% of people fall below. In our small sample of 25, this number was quite different from the population's. That’s not surprising maller samples often miss the highest (or lowest) values. When you're looking at extreme percentiles like the 98th, having a larger sample really matters. The density plot clearly shows how the sample didn’t fully capture the shape of the overall population.
